# RunEstimator

Simple World of Warcraft addOn that works in the chatbox/console. 
It calculates the number of runs or kills a player has to make in order to 
reach a specified probability to get an item with a specific chance to drop.

For installation, the folder containing the addOn should the placed in a directory such as 
C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\ 
or equivalent, and the addOn enabled in the checklist in the addOns tab in game.
