# RunEstimator

Simple World of Warcraft addOn that works in the chatbox/console. 
It calculates the number of runs or kills a player has to make in order to 
reach a specified probability to get an item with a specific chance to drop.

For installation, the folder containing the addOn should the placed in a directory such as 
C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\ 
or equivalent, and the addOn enabled in the checklist in the addOns tab in game.
Optionally, you can install it using the Curse client from the Curse website.

To use the addon type '/runs "dropchance" "desired probability"' without the ' ' (Example: /runs 32.15 90) 
This will output the line: 'RESULT: You need to make 6 runs to get an item with the dropchance 32.15% with 90% probability.'
